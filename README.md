# Gobble Gobble

```Take big bites. Anything worth doing is worth overdoing.```
â€”Robert A. Heinlein, **Time Enough for Love**

This is a toy markdown parser. I've written one using regular expressions before and I quickly felt I'd reached the limits of what I could do before things got unwieldy, so I shelved it for the time being and decided to revisit the subject when I'd learned more.

I was familiar with terms like abstract syntax trees and recursive descent but assumed they were way above my ability. Then I came across a book called Crafting Interpreters, which dedicates its first chapters to the subject, and presents it in a very approachable way. This encouraged me to pick up the subject again and see how far I can get now.
